                                       	Towards the end of the assignment period, you should reflect as a group on how well you think you have performed in
                                        this assignment. You should include whatever evidence you may have about the groups processes
                                        (such as commit trails from GitHub, or project meeting minutes).
                                        Each member of the group should contribute up
                                        to 200 words about their own perception of the group,
                                       and the group as a whole should contribute around 400 words.
                                        This should include the following attributes.
